# Video_Face_Swapping

Automatic face detecting and swapping between two videos is an interesting and non-trivial process. The
goal of this project is to take the face from the source video and transfer it to the target video seamlessly
while keeping the facial expressions of the source video. We propose to use techniques such as Delaunay
triangulation, image morphing, Poisson blending, and optical flow

Required installation:
cmake
dlib
